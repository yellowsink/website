Hi, I'm Cain Atkinson, known online as Yellowsink. I make dumb little
programs, and occasionally some cool stuff too.

I write a LOT of code - though being at college has pared that back.

My comfort lang is C#, but F# is really cool, so I use that a lot.

I used to use Go, and now use JS and TS a *ton* for web stuff.

I like to play rhythm games in my spare time, I used to play osu!, and got
reasonable during lockdown, but now I mostly play Quaver and Muse Dash.

I try to [keep up](https://anilist.co/user/yellowsink) with anime and stuff but usually forget.

All my software is free (as in beer).
If its helpful to you, a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/yellowsink) is always appreciated ;)
