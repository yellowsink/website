# Website V2

Or more accurately, the fourth iteration of my website.

The first iteration was simply a load of interconnected github pages sites, pretty basic.

The second iteration, which I consider to be "v1", is made in ASP.NET Core and published on Heroku, and is still my main site until this is done.

The third was a rewrite in Svelte from scratch on Vercel, which was going well until I stopped caring.

This one I intend to replace my existing site, and no attempt will be made to migrate old content over.

## Tech
This site is built with VSCode, Vite, SolidJS, & WindiCSS (because thats a really cool combo).

It has intelligent dark mode that knows when to follow your OS and when not to, and has routing via solid-app-router.

It uses WindiCSS' breakpoints to effortlessly respond to whatever size device you attempt to use,
so it looks natural yet consistent on both mobile and desktop.

## Misc
Feel free to use my dark mode implementation, just leave credit please kthx.
