Hi, I'm Hazel Atkinson
<a class="tag" href="https://en.pronouns.page/@yellowsink">she/her</a>,
known online as Yellowsink. I make dumb little
programs, and occasionally some cool stuff, sometimes.

These days most people know me from [modding Discord](https://github.com/uwu/shelter).

I like to play rhythm games in my spare time, I used to play osu!, and got
reasonable during lockdown, but now I mostly play Quaver and Muse Dash.

I try to [keep up](https://anilist.co/user/yellowsink) with anime and stuff but usually forget.
And I'm into that whole [scrobbling](https://listenbrainz.org/user/yellowsink/) thing.

I am an active member of [uwu.network](https://uwu.yellows.ink), where my [blog](https://uwu.network/~sink/blog) lives.
I'd love if some of ya would read it ^^.

There are some really cool people there, I love them all, go check it out :)

All my software is free (as in beer).
If it's helpful to you, a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/yellowsink) is always appreciated ;)
