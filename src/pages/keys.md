# Cryptographic Keys

[Keys](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)>) let you verify that something
was signed by me, or decrypt something I have encrypted.

This page lists where you can find my [public keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

You can verify my identity claims at https://keyoxide.org/sink%40uwu.network.
Most of my accounts and sites should be proven cryptographically there.

## SSH Keys

Want me to be able to sign in to your server? Here's the relevant keys.

My SSH keys can be found at https://github.com/yellowsink.keys.

I use separate keys for home servers I log in to, as well as for the AUR.

## PGP Keys

PGP keys are useful for signing and encrypting.

The PGP keys that I use for signing Git commits can be found at https://github.com/yellowsink.gpg.
These keys are used for Git and Git ONLY.
None of my other keys are used for Git.

My main PGP key used for signing and verifying can be found on https://keys.openpgp.org.
It has the fingerprint `6950 8A81 E697 A652 20C2 E707 DB78 982E 597E 772A` and is tied to `yellowsink@riseup.net`.

It can also be found via Web Key Directory (WKD) at [`sink@uwu.network`](https://uwu.network/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/phiagit188wgpu9qbkcm3frsbws76bmo).
