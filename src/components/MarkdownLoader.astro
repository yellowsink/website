      There would've been some dynamically fetched Markdown here, but you have
      Javascript disabled.

    <p>Here is a <a href={src}>link</a> to the md file</p>

      This site used to rely on Javascript, but thanks to the magic of Astro, no
      longer does.

      However, as I just statically build it, I still can't get Markdown to work
      without client-side JS.
