# Discord plugins

I built plugins for the chat app Discord on the Cumcord plugin loader.

They are all now deprecated, unmaintained, and probably broken.

See more about this [here](/client_mods).

I will be working on something new in this field, but you will have to check back later.

## shelter

Hey all, it's me again from 3 months later, I have more plugins for shelter now!
