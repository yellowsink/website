# Discord plugins

I built plugins for the chat app Discord on the Cumcord plugin loader.

They are all now deprecated, unmaintained, and probably broken.

See more about this [here](/client_mods).

[My unmaintained CC plugins](https://yellowsink.github.io/cc-plugins).

I have since written plugins for my new plugin loader: shelter:

<div style="margin: .5rem; padding: .5rem; border: 1px dotted currentColor">
	<MarkdownLoader src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yellowsink/shelter-plugins/master/README.md" />
</div>
