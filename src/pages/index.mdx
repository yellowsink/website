Hi, I'm Cain Atkinson
<a class="tag" href="https://en.pronouns.page/@yellowsink">he/him</a>,
known online as Yellowsink. I make dumb little
programs, and occasionally some cool stuff too.

I write a LOT of code - though being at college has pared that back.

My comfort lang is C#, but F# is really cool, so I use that a lot.
I used to use Go, and now use JS and TS a *ton* for web stuff, as well as a bit of Dlang.

I like to play rhythm games in my spare time, I used to play osu!, and got
reasonable during lockdown, but now I mostly play Quaver and Muse Dash.

I try to [keep up](https://anilist.co/user/yellowsink) with anime and stuff but usually forget.

I am an active member of [uwu.network](https://uwu.yellows.ink).
There are some really cool people there, go check it out :)

That is also where my [blog](https://uwu.network/~sink/blog) lives.

All my software is free (as in beer).
If its helpful to you, a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/yellowsink) is always appreciated ;)
