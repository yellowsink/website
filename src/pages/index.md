Hi, I'm Cain Atkinson, known online as Yellowsink. I make dumb little
programs, and occasionally some cool stuff too.

### Programming

My most comfortable programming language is C# (At this point I know .NET
like the back of my hand). F# is really cool, but most people think it's
horrific. I sometimes use Go because why not? I have recently been using
JS a lot to make Discord plugins, as well as this site, and a little
webdev for a client mod.

### Rhythm Gaming

I mostly play osu!, though I've been giving taiko a go recently. tau is fun.
