## WacomAreaX11

**A delightful GUI for setting up tablets on Linux, with an equally delightful TUI to match.**

---

### Why?

At first glance, setting tablet areas in Wacom drivers may not seem like
an issue - here's a reasonable example:

```bash
xsetwacom set 13 Area 2000 3000 6800 6800
```

This code sets device 13's area to 20mm from left, 30mm from top, 48mm
wide, and 38mm high.

However, what happens when we add rotation in the mix?

```bash
xsetwacom set 13 Area 5460 1868 7597 5668
xsetwacom set 13 Rotate ccw
```

Now this is significantly less readable! This is the actual area I use on
my tablet for playing osu!, and it gets very confusing to work out.

**Why work this out manually when I can write a full front-end to xsetwacom instead?**

### Truly wonderful presets

Most tablet driver tools require loading presets into the software itself.
While both the TUI and GUI will list available presets and allow loading
them easily, This is completely redundant as long as the user is either
comfortable on the command line, or their file manager can run shell
scripts.

Long story short, this tool saves its presets as executable shell scripts.
Here's an example - the aformetioned tablet area I use for osu!.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# This file was generated by WacomAreaX11

xsetwacom set "Wacom Bamboo Pen Pen stylus" Area 5460 1868 7597 5668
xsetwacom set "Wacom Bamboo Pen Pen stylus" Rotate Ccw
xsetwacom set "Wacom Bamboo Pen Pen stylus" RawSample 1
```

</div>

### How do I get it?

.NET 5 SDK is required to build. Runtime dependencies are the xsetwacom CLI tool, and MS fonts for the GUI.

If you're on Arch, use the AUR package - wacomareax11-git, note that this depends on ttf-win10-auto, though.

Else just clone and build like any other .NET app. The CLI tool should be
installed to path as wacomareax11 and the GUI as wacomareax11_gui.

### Wayland support?

This tool DOES NOT support Wayland, mainly because xsetwacom does not.
This is because xwayland, while it does forward the tablets from libinput
to X clients, does not forward all the special attributes specific to the
xf86-input-wacom driver, therefore the tablet cannot be configured from
inside xwayland clients.

As for libinput control tools to use in place of xsetwacom, there
currently are none. :( The only tools that control tablets via libinput
are (as far as I can find) in the form of KDE settings modules.

How do I use my tablet on Wayland then? Do I need to go back to X? Simple:
use [OpenTabletDriver](https://opentabletdriver.net/). (Top
tip: if it doesn't work, fix your perms with the following, and note that
I have been unable to get the systemd service to work)
`sudo chmod 0666 /dev/uinput`
