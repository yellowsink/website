# Website V2

Or more accurately, the fourth iteration of my website.

The first iteration was simply a load of interconnected github pages sites, pretty basic.

The second iteration, which I consider to be "v1", is made in ASP.NET Core and published on Heroku, and is now left dormant.

The third was a rewrite in SvelteKit from scratch, which was going well until I stopped caring.

This one is now my current website, and no attempt has be made to migrate old content over.

## Tech
This site is built with VSCode and Astro.

Though it originally used solidjs + windicss and was a client app.

It has intelligent dark mode that knows when to follow your OS and when not to.

It uses ~~WindiCSS'~~ breakpoints to ~~effortlessly~~ respond to whatever size device you attempt to use,
so it looks natural yet consistent on both mobile and desktop.

## Misc
Feel free to use my dark mode implementation, just leave credit please kthx.
