Hi, I'm Hazel Atkinson
<a class="tag" href="https://en.pronouns.page/@yellowsink">she/her</a>,
known online as Yellowsink or hazeler. I'm a fluffy creature who makes software that is occasionally cool,
and a big big nerd math student.

You likely know me from either [modding Discord](https://github.com/uwu/shelter),
my [other software](https://github.com/yellowsink), or the [uwu.network](https://uwu.network) developer collective.

I may have also have [photograhed you at FWA 2025](https://furtrack.com/user/_hazeler/album-7281)!

I don't play video games so often, but I do play DiRT Rally a lot, and I have been known to like a good rhythm game.

I try to keep up with [anime](https://anilist.co/user/yellowsink) and [stuff](https://simkl.com/6441069)
but usually forget. And I'm into that whole [scrobbling](https://listenbrainz.org/user/yellowsink/) thing.

I [blog](https://uwu.network/~sink/blog) about my shenanigans occasionally, I'd love if some of ya would read it ^^.

All my software is free (as in beer).
If it's helpful to you, a [coffee](/pay) is always appreciated ;)
