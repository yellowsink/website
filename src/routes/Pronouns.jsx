    <h2>Pronouns, Grammatically.</h2>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>
      Why am I writing an article on pronouns in the English language? It's kind
      of out of place for my site I am aware, but something I have seen trip
      people up, both non-native speakers, but also native Brits I know
      personally as well. This article aims to explain how pronouns work in
      English, including and especially singular use cases of plural pronouns.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for required context if you somehow didn't already know (?), grammar
      is the set of rules that govern how words are collected together into
      larger text, such as this sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, this does page explain very very very basic things, to a frankly
      patronising degree, but I want to make sure we all have the same
      foundation for me to try to explain singular use of plural pronouns off
      of.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Grammar: Singular and Plural</h3>
    <p>
      We need to be rock-solid on our definitions and understanding to hit the
      nail on the head with any level of ease, but I'll keep it brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singular is the concept of a single thing. For example, the apple, a dog,
      one ice cream. This also happens to be how we refer to single people: the
      most common use of pronouns! (he/she/you/etc)
    </p>
    <p>
      Plural is the concept of multiple things. For example: the apples, some
      dogs, 3 ice creams. While we more often refer to single people, we often
      do refer to people in plurals: groups of people! (us/them/etc)
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Grammar: Pronouns</h3>
    <p>
      The most basic and obvious way to address each other in any language,
      including English, is via names. In some languages, this is even the
      standard (Japanese uses names almost exclusively, simply omitting
      specifiers of who did what where possible to infer: indeed pronouns are
      seen as rude).
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with addressing each other with names all the time is that it
      gets very long very quick. Here is an example why (in this example the
      speaker is called 'Jim'):{" "}
      <i>
        At the weekend <strong>Jim</strong> is going to meet up with{" "}
        <strong>Jim's</strong> friend <strong>Sally</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>Jim and Sally</strong> will talk about a common interest{" "}
        <strong>Jim and Sally</strong> have.
      </i>{" "}
      I have highlighted the proper nouns (names).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pronouns can replace all these verbs with shorter standins:{" "}
      <i>
        At the weekend <strong>I</strong> am going to meet up with{" "}
        <strong>my</strong> friend <strong>Sally</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>we</strong> will talk about a common interest{" "}
        <strong>we</strong> have.
      </i>
    </p>

    <h3>Grammatically singular pronouns</h3>
    <p>
      Some pronouns are gramatically singular. This means that, according to
      grammar, they are to be used to refer to one person. The two most used are
      he/him and she/her.
    </p>
    <p>For examples' sake: He went to the shop. This orange is hers.</p>

    <h3>Grammatically plural pronouns</h3>
    <p>
      Some pronouns are gramatically plural. This means that, according to
      grammar, they are to be used to refer to a group of people. The two most
      used are we/us/our and they/them.
    </p>
    <p>For examples' sake: We went to the shop. This orange is theirs.</p>

    <h3>Singular uses of grammatically plural pronouns</h3>
    <p>Wow that subheading is a mouthful.</p>
    <p>
      The modern world has moved on past these concepts, and lots of people now
      like a different way to refer to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these people want to communicate without having to implicitly
      convey gender information, as required by the two overwhelmingly common
      sets of singluar pronouns, and some don't fall in to either of the two
      most common categories.
    </p>
    <p>(Can you tell I'm being careful with my wording here?) :p</p>
    <p>
      Enter the existing non gendered pronoun in English: they/them! This
      pronoun conveys fits this case perfectly (unlike plural pronouns in some
      languages like French). Hence its the perfect fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain and simple: you refer to a single person as they/them, rather
      than a group. The second example from the plural section (This orange is
      theirs) still works just fine, except "theirs" refers to a person, not
      people.
    </p>

    <h3>So how do these work in a sentence?</h3>
    <p>
      The two things I've seen trip people up are these two: how these are
      classified, and how these are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, classification. These pronouns <i>are plural grammatically</i>.
      They just are. And no, you can't argue this: for example, the following
      sentence doesn't sound right, does it?: <i>They is a nice person.</i>{" "}
      "They" and "is" do not work together because they are grammatically
      incommpatible. So yes, these are plural.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOWEVER, the use case is singular - so second, usage: While sentences may
      be constructed with "are" not "is", etc., the person referred to is not
      multiple people! So you need to accept that these pronouns do break
      grammatical rules, even though they really don't sound that unnatural in
      use, mainly because the sentences already fit fine, the subject is just
      one not many.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Plural pronouns are used for single people in the modern world, and that's
      just how it is. It takes a bit to get your head around it, but if you just
      talk as if the person is a group of people, then you will end up with
      natural use of this situation, despite its contradiction of grammatical
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: I have no qualification in linguistics, and nothing to back me up
      here, so take that as you will.
